# NebulaOps Observability Platform (Master's thesis)

NebulaOps is a production-grade observability and performance engineering platform created as the foundation of my master's thesis. It combines infrastructure-as-code, multi-cloud deployment strategies, and deep observability automation to provide a compelling DevOps story for modern SaaS workloads.

## Why it matters for DevOps portfolios

- **End-to-end narrative** â€“ From Terraform provisioning through automated load testing with k6 and Grafana analytics, NebulaOps demonstrates complete platform ownership.
- **Multi-cloud fluency** â€“ Ready-to-run deployments for Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure highlight cloud-agnostic architecture and portability skills.
- **Observability first** â€“ Managed Prometheus, custom dashboards, and automated annotations ensure every test is measurable and auditable.
- **Production thinking** â€“ Opinionated naming conventions, security guardrails, and Git-based workflows reflect real-world delivery constraints.

## Platform overview

NebulaOps simulates a cloud-native ecommerce workload and instrumented observability stack. It provisions infrastructure with Terraform, deploys workloads via container registries, and executes repeatable load tests that annotate Grafana dashboards for precise performance storytelling. The platform can run fully locally with Docker Compose or be promoted to managed services on GCP and Azure.

## DevOps lifecycle walkthrough

1. **Plan** â€“ Define target cloud (GCP or Azure) and adjust Terraform variables to match capacity requirements.
2. **Provision** â€“ Apply Terraform configurations to create networking, managed databases, and container runtimes.
3. **Package** â€“ Build workload images (Django ecommerce demo) and push them to the cloud-specific registry.
4. **Deploy** â€“ Release container revisions through Cloud Run or Azure Container Apps with observability sidecars enabled.
5. **Test** â€“ Execute k6 suites from the `load-tests` runner to stress the platform and tag dashboards automatically.
6. **Observe** â€“ Analyze Grafana dashboards (imported via `provisioning/`) enriched by load test annotations.
7. **Iterate** â€“ Capture findings, adjust Terraform or application configuration, and rerun the pipeline.

## Quick start

> ðŸ§­ Choose your path: [Local lab](#local-lab-setup), [Google Cloud](docs/deployment-gcp.md), or [Microsoft Azure](docs/deployment-azure.md).

### Local lab setup

1. **Install prerequisites** â€“ Docker Desktop (or podman), Node.js 20+, and Terraform 1.7+.
2. **Bootstrap dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run format:check
   ```
3. **Launch observability stack**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
4. **Customize credentials** in [`load-tests/.env.example`](load-tests/.env.example) and run a smoke test:
   ```bash
   npm run format
   docker build -t nebulaops-k6 load-tests
   docker run --rm --env-file=load-tests/.env.example nebulaops-k6 run tests/test-check.ts
   ```
5. **Open Grafana** at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and explore pre-provisioned dashboards.

## Operations guide

### Running the full ecommerce scenario

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e GRAFANA_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3000 \
  -e GRAFANA_TOKEN=<token> \
  -e DASHBOARD_IDS_TO_ANNOTATE=4,10 \
  nebulaops-k6 run tests/ecommerce-test.ts
```

The script executes cold start, steady load, stress, spike, and soak phases while pushing annotations to Grafana for each phase boundary.

### Formatting & linting

Maintain code quality with:

```bash
npm run format
npm run format:check
```

### Terraform validation

Before applying infrastructure changes, run:

```bash
cd terraform_deploys/<cloud>
terraform init
terraform validate -var-file="cloud_env.tfvars"
```

## Dashboards & reporting

- **Grafana provisioning** â€“ Dashboards, alert rules, and data sources live under `provisioning/`. They automatically load when Grafana starts locally or through Terraform bootstrapping in the cloud.
- **Managed Prometheus** â€“ Google Managed Service for Prometheus is enabled via Terraform and mirrored by Azure Monitor-managed Prometheus equivalents.
- **Annotations** â€“ Each load test phase posts a descriptive annotation, enabling time-aligned storytelling during portfolio reviews.

## Portfolio highlights

- Crafted as the centrepiece of a master's thesis to illustrate real-world DevOps competencies.
- Demonstrates cross-cloud expertise with opinionated yet adaptable Terraform templates.
- Provides measurable outcomes through reproducible load tests, enabling data-backed retrospectives.
- Includes narrative-friendly documentation (this README + `/docs`) to support interviews and presentations.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Automate CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for provisioning, testing, and regression checks.
- [ ] Add Loki-based log aggregation with sample alerts.
- [ ] Publish reference Grafana screenshots and storytelling scripts.
- [ ] Expand k6 scenarios with business metrics (conversion, latency SLOs).
